    "Ordinal Encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, but it also considers the order or rank of the categories.\n",
    "It is suitable for categorical variables where the categories have a meaningful order or hierarchy.\n",
    "For example, ordinal encoding might assign the labels {\"Low\": 0, \"Medium\": 1, \"High\": 2} to a variable indicating the level of risk.\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding also assigns a unique integer value to each category, but it does not consider any inherent order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "It is appropriate for categorical variables where there is no meaningful order or hierarchy.\n",
    "For example, label encoding might assign the labels {\"Red\": 0, \"Blue\": 1, \"Green\": 2} to a variable indicating colors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding considers the order of the categories (\"Compact\" < \"Midsize\" < \"Full-size\") and assigns numeric labels accordingly.\n",
    "Label Encoding does not consider any order among the categories and simply assigns numeric labels arbitrarily.\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy that needs to be preserved. For example, levels of education (\"High School\" < \"Bachelor's\" < \"Master's\" < \"PhD\").\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when there is no meaningful order among the categories, and they can be treated as nominal. For example, types of fruits (\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\")."

You believe that there is a monotonic relationship between tenure and the likelihood of churnâ€”customers who have been with the company for a longer tenure are less likely to churn.\n",

The categories of \"Tenure\" can be ordered based on the average churn rate within each category. Categories with lower churn rates are assigned lower numeric labels, while categories with higher churn rates are assigned higher numeric labels. This encoding captures the monotonic relationship between tenure and churn, allowing the model to effectively learn from this feature.\n",
